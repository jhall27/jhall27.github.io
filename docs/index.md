## About
Senior  Honors Computer Science student. 


This repo is super light. No config needed. You don't need to setup a theme or a layout. GitHub will figure that out and will apply its standard theme to your GitHub Pages site. So will it will have a clean, white, mobile-friendly site with a heading. The limitations are covered more on these pages, such as lack of a navbar. But you can still setup links to pages, as with the Menu below.
