## About
Senior  Honors Computer Science student. 


This repo is super light. No config needed. You don't need to setup a theme or a layout. GitHub will figure that out and will apply its standard theme to your GitHub Pages site. So will it will have a clean, white, mobile-friendly site with a heading. The limitations are covered more on these pages, such as lack of a navbar. But you can still setup links to pages, as with the Menu below.

The page you are currently viewing is `README.md` in the docs directory, with path set as `/` in the frontmatter. Alternatively, you can add `index.md` or `index.html` as your homepage. I just like how a README.md previews well in GitHub.


## How to use this project

- Template for a new project or docs site. Or use as a reference for existing projects.

## Documentation template

If you're looking for template docs which you can easily edit and reuse for your own site, rather see my [Generic Project Template](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/generic-project-template/) project's docs. It uses the same docs site approach as this one.
